# Lab 1 – Vibe Coding 101 

Create a Ping-Pong game using Python 🏓

### Analyze the Results

    1. Code Quality
        - ChatGPT: Code is shorter and simpler. It was easier to understand becuase functions as make_paddle and make_ball have intuitive names, and detailed comments helps understand what each part of the code does. However, most of the game logic is located inside of the while True loop, makinf the code harder to maintain as the game grows.
        - Cursor: The code is longer and more complex, but it is also more structured. Each component has a clearly defined role, which makes the code easier to maintain. Although the comments are not very detailed as ChatGPT’s, they are enough to understand the overall logic.

    2. Speed of Generation
        - ChatGPT: Code was generated very quickly with a single prompt.
        - Cursor: The initial generation took longer than ChatGPT, but modifications and improvements were faster.


    3. Ease of Use
        - ChatGPT: It is very intuitive, becuase it generates code directly from text descriptions. However, users need to create the file, copy and paste the code into it, and run it themselves.
        - Cursor: For beginner, it is quite more difficult to use it becuase its interface is a bit more complicated than ChatGPT, but it is more efficient and convenient because the generated code is automatically integrated with Python files.

    4. Debugging and Error Handling
        - ChatGPT: Users can debug by by pasting error codes and messages into the chat, but they need to frequently whitch between the code and the chat tab. In addition, the suggested solutions are not always completely accurate.
        - Cursor: Debugging is faster and more efficient since changes can be made and tested directly in the editor, and the suggested fixes tend to be more accurate.

    5. Flexibility and Customization
        - ChatGPT: Adding major new features can be relatively complex, but small customizations (such as changing the game speed) are easy because they only require minor edits at the top of the code.
        - Cursor: The code is more flexible because its sturcture is well organized. Adding new features and customization are easier.
